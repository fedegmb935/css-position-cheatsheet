# css-position-cheatsheet
Build your Own Cheatsheet Challenge on Codecademy.com

This project is part of the Full-Stack Development curriculum on Codecademy.com.
For this project, I was asked to build a cheatsheet about a HTML or CSS topic of choice using HTML Tables. I choose the CSS Position property since it took quite a while for me to understand it.
